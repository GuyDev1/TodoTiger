# TodoTiger
### A nice simple Todo App I developed.

The app uses Google's Firebase platform for authentication and Realtime Database access.
It also includes a feature not seen in many TODO apps - a location reminder for task lists.
Using Google Maps and Geofence API's, this enables users to perform according to GTD principles,
receiving a notification when they reach a location that they previously set using Google Maps.
