# TodoTiger
### A nice simple Todo App I developed.

The app uses Google's Firebase platform for authentication and Realtime Database access.
It also includes a feature never before seen in a Todo app - a location reminder for task lists.
Using Google Maps and Geofence API's, this enables users to perform according to GTD principles,
receiving a notification when they reach a location that they previously set using Google Maps.

#### Give the app a try! - Download the APK here: https://tinyurl.com/yxqlzwgw
#### If you're at it - Try long clicking a List in the main screen to set a location reminder
